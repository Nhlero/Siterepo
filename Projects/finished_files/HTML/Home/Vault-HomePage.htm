            <h3>Backup (BU)</h3> 
            <p>Backups are simple; they are a copy of your corporate systems and data that can be used to bring a failed system back online. However, backups do not necessarily include the infrastructure to restore to – you may have a copy of the data or systems, but no infrastructure to run those systems or process that data. If your systems have been backed up to disk, tape, or the cloud, it may be very time consuming to utilise these backups when you have a need. </p>

            <h3>Disaster Recovery (DR) </h3>
            <p>DR refers to a more advanced form of system copies that include processing capabilities.

Although each is a different business continuity and IT security solution, many companies are combining data backup and disaster recovery into one comprehensive solution for easier and fast </p>

            <h3>High Availability (HA) </h3>
            <p>High Availability, or “HA: typically refers to local system redundancy. An HA platform has at least two of everything so that a secondary system can take the place of a primary system if the primary fails. HA systems are much more difficult to bring down, as they can typically take the failure of any single component. </p>
